# Values

Your core principles, priorities, and decision-making frameworks. This file helps Hyperion understand what matters most to you and make suggestions aligned with your values.

## Core Values

The principles that guide your decisions.

<!-- Example:
### Integrity
Act honestly even when no one is watching. Keep commitments.

### Growth
Continuously learn and improve. Embrace discomfort as a signal of growth.

### Impact
Focus on work that matters. Prefer depth over breadth.

### Balance
Sustainable pace over burnout. Family and health are non-negotiable.
-->

## Priorities (Ordered)

When values conflict, this is your priority order.

<!-- Example:
1. **Health** - Can't help others if you're broken
2. **Family** - Relationships over achievements
3. **Financial Security** - Foundation for everything else
4. **Career Growth** - Long-term over short-term
5. **Side Projects** - Important but not at expense of above
-->

## Decision Frameworks

How you approach decisions.

<!-- Example:
### For Career Decisions
- Will I learn significantly?
- Does it align with 5-year vision?
- Can I maintain work-life balance?

### For Spending Decisions
- Does this buy time or happiness?
- Is this a need or a want?
- What's the per-use cost?

### For Time Commitments
- Does this align with current goals?
- Can I say no without burning bridges?
- Is this urgent or just loud?
-->

## Principles

Rules of thumb you live by.

<!-- Example:
- Ship fast, iterate faster
- Done is better than perfect
- If it takes <2 minutes, do it now
- Default to yes for new experiences, no for new commitments
- Measure what matters, ignore vanity metrics
- When in doubt, choose the harder path
- Invest in relationships; they compound
-->

## Anti-Values

Things you actively avoid.

<!-- Example:
- Grinding without purpose
- Optimizing for others' expectations
- Short-term gains at long-term cost
- Busywork disguised as productivity
-->

## Constraints

Non-negotiable boundaries.

<!-- Example:
- No work after 8pm on weekdays
- Weekends protected for family
- Exercise 4x/week minimum
- 8 hours sleep non-negotiable
- No meetings before 10am
-->
